Arbitrary Radio astronomiCAl pipeliNE suite (arcane_suite)
==========================================================

``arcane_suite`` is a collection of *arbitrary* analitycs and utility command-line tools & libararies and pre-defined pieplines built in `Snakemake <https://snakemake.github.io/>`_.

Pipelines
---------

Each pipeline included in `arcane_suite` is designed to perform a well-defined simple task, and so *only* allowing for *limited* parametrization. Nonetheless, each pipeline comes with its own script that can initialise the building of the pipeline based on a configuration file. So building and running these pipelines should be done with minimal effort.

TO DO: add a short description to where the pipeline-specific code is stored

TO DO: add a list starting with the otfms pipeline and initialise its documantation
