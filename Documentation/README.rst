Arbitrary Radio astronomiCAl pipeliNE suite (arcane_suite)
==========================================================

``arcane_suite`` is a collection of *arbitrary* analytic and utility command-line tools & libraries and pre-defined pipelines built in ``Snakemake``. For a quick overview of the library's structure, and a brief description of the architecture and development ideas, see the `design & philosophy <https://github.com/rstofi/arcane_suite/blob/main/Documentation/Design_and_Philosophy.rst>`_ page.

The main ``arcane_suite`` components are:

* `Pipelines`_
* `Utils (Modules)`_
* `Tools`_
* `Apps`_


Pipelines
---------



..
    Each pipeline included in ``arcane_suite`` is designed to perform a well-defined simple task, and so *only* allowing for *limited* parameterization. Nonetheless, each pipeline comes with its own script that can initialize the building of the pipeline based on a configuration file. So building and running these pipelines should be done with minimal effort.

TO DO: add a short description to where the pipeline-specific code is stored

TO DO: add a list starting with the otfms pipeline and initialize its documentation

Utils (Modules)
---------------

TO DO: describe the utility libraries used

Tools

TO DO: describe the planned tools

Apps
