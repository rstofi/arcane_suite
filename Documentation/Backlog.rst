Known bugs/issues
-----------------

Bugs and issues, I am aware and should fix, but are not currently affecting the code performance.

    - there leftover ``CASA`` log ad param files in the ``otfms`` pipeline
    - handeling empty calibrator fields list in ``otfms``

Goals for version update
------------------------

My goals for a minor version update.

    - add a rule to clean up the intermediate files in ``otfms``
    - finish the `design & philosophy <https://github.com/rstofi/arcane_suite/blob/main/Documentation/Design_and_Philosophy.rst>`_ page
    - add documentation for the ``otfms`` pipeline
    - factorize the tasks(i.e. from the code add to casa_wrapper): ``run_:casa_executable``, ``create_casa_merge_executable`` + same for split and add listobs a s an option to both


Long-term goals
---------------

Some of my ideas for the future directions of the code.

    - add ``arcane_suite`` to pip
    - add testing module based on ``ChatGPT`` code
    - make a separate ``arrcane_tools`` library
