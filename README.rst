==========================================================

Many radio astronomical pipelines are data-driven, yet emberassingly parallel and simple at the same time. arcane-suite is a set of *arbitrary* `Snakemake <https://snakemake.github.io/>`_ pipelines that can be easily deployed and run based on user-defined configuration files.
